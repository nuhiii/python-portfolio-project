    I possess a deep passion for technology, holding a degree in Computer Science from Columbia Universityâ€”
    an esteemed Ivy League Institution consistently ranked among the top 5 universities globally.
    Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in the realm of Artificial 
    Intelligence, by pursuing the Intelligent Systems track and diving into various coursework and projects. 
    I took part in internship roles, partnering with further renowned institutions, that allowed me to bridge the gap 
    between a theoretical learning approach and active hands on research. I took the knowledge I gained from
    university and applied them to real world scenarios, at companies seeking to make an impact on the world. As such,
    I had the privilege of conducting research projects with CERN, Amazon, and IBM to name a few.
    Beyond formal education, I actively pursued self-learning, through open source. All in all, my journey in the world 
    of technology has been marked by a diverse range of experiences that have honed my skills and knowledge. Below are 
    a few of the projects I have worked on to showcase my technical proficiency, especially with the Python 
    programming language. In any case, feel free to contact me!
